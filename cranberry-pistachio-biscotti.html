    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These cranberry pistachio cookies studded with red and green colors make great Christmas cookies. I have used
        other nuts instead of pistachios with success.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
     <li>&frac34; cup white sugar</li>

     <li> &frac12; cup light olive oil </li>

     <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract </li>

     <li>&frac12; teaspoon almond extract </li>

     <li>2 large eggs</li>

     <li> 1&frac34; cups all-purpose flour</li>

     <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>

     <li>&frac14; teaspoon salt</li>

     <li>1&frac12; cups pistachio nuts</li>

     <li>&frac12; cup dried cranberries</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 300&#8457; (150&#8451;). Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper</li>
        <li>Mix together sugar and oil in a large bowl until well blended. Mix in vanilla and almond extracts, then beat in eggs. Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl; gradually stir into egg mixture until combined. Fold in pistachios and cranberries by hand</li>
        <li>Divide dough in half. Form each piece into a 12x2-inch log on the prepared cookie sheet. Dough may be sticky; wet hands with cool water to handle dough more easily.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until logs are light brown, about 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce oven temperature to 275&#8457;(135&#8451;).</li>
        <li>Cut logs on the diagonal into &frac34;-inch-thick slices. Lay cookies cut-side down on the cookie sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake cookies until dry, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
