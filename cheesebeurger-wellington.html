    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This gorgeous, budget-friendly version of Beef Wellington is sure to impress your guests, both visually and
        flavor-wise. Just please don't tell them how easy it was, since we chefs like it when people think these kinds
        of things are complex, and require a high level of skill. In fact, this might be easier than making an actual
        bacon cheeseburger. Which reminds meâ€¦this isn't as good as an actual bacon cheeseburger.</p>
    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 ounce frozen puff pastry</li>
        <li>1 slice bacon, cut in half</li>
        <li>8 ounce ground beef</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>cayenne pepper to taste</li>
        <li>&frac12; ounce sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Place bacon in a large cold skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly
                browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Drain bacon fat and wipe the pan, but do
                not clean completely.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Shape ground beef into a patty that is about 1 inch thick by 4&frac14; inches in diameter. Season well
                with
                salt, pepper, and cayenne. Sear seasoned burger on high in the skillet for 2 minutes per side. Move the
                burger to a plate and transfer into a refrigerator to cool.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Remove a sheet of puff pastry from the freezer (I used &frac12; package of Dufour Puff Pastry). Roll the
                pastry to &frac18; inch thick. Cut out a 5&frac14; to 5&frac12; inch round circle of dough for the
                bottom. Cut out a
                7&frac14; to 7&frac12;-inch round circle of dough for the top. Place the dough on a sheet pan, and put
                in the
                freezer until firm.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Cut a small hole into the middle of the top piece (to function as a vent), and lightly score the surface
                of the pastry with the tip of a knife, but do not cut all the way through. Place the top piece in the
                fridge to keep cold.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Take the bottom pastry on the pan from the freezer and top with burger, bacon, and cheese. Beat egg with
                1 teaspoon water in a small bowl and brush the edges with the egg wash. Place the top pastry piece over
                the fillings. As dough warms and softens, press the top edges into the bottom piece edges and seal
                tightly. The bottom edge of dough can be rolled up and over top of the pastry to finish the seal. Place
                in the fridge until well chilled, about 20 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 450&#8457; (230&#8451;).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Crimp the edge of the pastry with a fork, and egg wash the top surface.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven until nicely browned, 20 to 22 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack and allow
                to sit for about 5 minutes before serving.</p>
        </li>
